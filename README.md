Personal Finance Tracker / Python, Dash & Plotly, Pandas, HTML/CSS

An interactive web application to visualize personal financial transactions over time. The app provides dynamic charting and filtering capabilities, helping users understand spending patterns and trends at a glance. 

As of now when the list of transactions (.csv) is uploaded, data visualization of income/expenses over time is given.

Will be using Plaid APIs in the future to gather live data and have it visualized in the future along with income and expense usage and additional features to give beneficial feedback regarding the user's finances.
